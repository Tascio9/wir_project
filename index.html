    <h1>– Introduction</h1>
    <h3>Building the dataset for our project wasn't so easy. </h3>
    <p>Nowadays it's common to find unlabeled data
        and labeling them is very time consuming, but sometimes it's necessary.<br>
        We are dealing with social data, retrieved by Twitter: in our project we've tried to manually
        classify tweets but wasn't easy because a quick look to them it's not enough.</p>

    <h1>– Why classify tweets?</h1>
    <p>The idea is the following: if I'm curious about some "Sports" news, I want to read them by
        applying a simple filter about Sport and dinamically show the result with the newest/hottest tweets
        about sport news.</p>
    <p> But first of all, let's give a look to build a <a href = "dataset.html">dataset</a> from Twitter's API.</p>
